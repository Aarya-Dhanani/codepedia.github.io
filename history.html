          Historians recognise Ada Lovelace as the first computer programmer.
          Ada, born in 1815, studied mathematics, which at the time was highly
          unusual for a woman. After meeting Charles Babbage, the inventor of
          the Analytical Engine, Ada was entranced. In 1843, she published an
          article about the machine, translated from French, adding in her own
          extensive notes, which came to be recognised as the first algorithm
          intended to be processed by a machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lovelace’s contribution to coding was just the beginning. In 1923,
          German military combined coding and electricity, communicating via
          secret coded messages on the Enigma machine. Alan Turing famously
          cracked the code, reportedly helping end the war two years earlier
          than predicted. Turing later took the concept and evolved it, creating
          a more flexible machine in 1936. Unlike its predecessors, Turing’s
          computer could complete more than one task, due to its ability to read
          multiple instructions in binary code.
        </p>
        <p>
          The drawback to Turing’s design was the fact that it read instructions
          via long tapes of paper, which proved impractical. In 1948,
          researchers at Manchester University came up with a solution – the
          ability to store memory via electricity. Their computer was programmed
          via binary code, held 128 bytes of memory, and was large enough to
          fill an entire room.
        </p>
        <p>
          The late 1950s saw the invention of coding languages that are still in
          use today – specifically, FORTRAN, LISP and COBOL. Technology swiftly
          unfolded throughout the 60s, with the notion of computer gaming being
          born, the mouse being invented, and ARPANET, the predecessor to the
          internet, being created. The 1970s brought further development: the
          high-level programming language PASCAL was forged; interestingly, it
          is still used by Skype today.
